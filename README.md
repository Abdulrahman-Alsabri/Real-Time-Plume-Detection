# Real-Time Plume Detection
## About the Project
[Real-Time Plume Detection](https://sites.google.com/my.fit.edu/real-time-plume-detection "Project's Website") is an AI-based (Artificial Intelligence) project for Computer Science Senior Project course and sponsored by [Sentry View Systems.](https://sentryviewsystems.com/ "Sentry's Home Page") This project aims to detect plumes autonomously along the Indian River Lagoon initially, and hopefully along other rivers eventually.

## Concept
The Plume Detection process starts by deploying a medium size unmanned boat with a sensor station, programmed to read data (i.e. water concentration levels) as it moves in a "zigzag" predefined path along the Indian River Lagoon. The AI (Artificial Intelligence) system of the project gets activated when the concentration levels starts changing significantly, indicating a possible presence of a plume. The main objective of the AI system is to guide the boat into the boundaries of the plume, and mapping the results in real-time to a user interface system.
